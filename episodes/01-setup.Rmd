This lesson was developed and tested with `r R.version.string`.

Take a moment to launch RStudio and verify that you are using R version `4.1.x` (`x` being any patch version, for instance `4.1.0`).
Bioconductor uses the version of R running in the current session to determine the latest version of Bioconductor packages that was tested for compatibility with that version of R.
Using a different version of R while following this lesson may lead to unexpected results.
