# Getting help with Bioconductor packages

Help about Bioconductor packages and best practices is available in several places.
Often, the best source of help depends on the situation at hand:

- Are you trying to identify the best package for a particular task?
- Are you trying to use a package for the very first time?
- Are you unsure about best practices to use and combine multiple packages and functions in a sensible workflow?
- Is a function throwing an error when you apply it to your data?
- Do you have questions about the theory or methodology implemented in a particular package or function?

In the next sections, we describe different sources of help available to Bioconductor users, and situations where each of them are most useful.

# The Bioconductor website

The main [Bioconductor website][bioc-website] provides a host of resources, all freely available without even the need to install R or any Bioconductor package.

In particular, the [biocViews][biocviews-site] page is a great way to thematically explore the collection of packages and identify Bioconductor packages providing a certain functionality.

Furthermore, the website also collects materials from [courses and conferences][bioc-courses-conferences-materials], including presentations, video recordings, and teaching materials.

By nature, individual presentations and training materials are often tied to a specific version of Bioconductor packages.
As such, they provide a snapshot of best practices at a particular point in time, and may become outdated over time with successive Bioconductor release.
Thus, it is important check the version of packages demonstrated in teaching materials matches that in the user's R library.
Alternatively, when referring to materials that employ package versions different from those in the user's library, it is important to carefully interpret any discrepancy between the expected and actual results.

# Package landing pages

Each package accepted in the Bioconductor project is granted a landing page on the main Bioconductor website, e.g. `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("S4Vectors")`.

Package landing pages contains useful information that can be consulted without the need to install a package.
This is particularly useful while browsing the Bioconductor repository is search of packages suitable for a specific task.

On the landing page, prospective users can find a short description of the package functionality, as well as pre-compiled documentation in the form of links to [package vignettes][glossary-vignette].
Vignettes represent a particularly powerful form of documentation as they allow package developers to demonstrate the functionality of their package in the context of an example data set and workflow (sometimes more than one).

In particular, precompiled vignettes available on the Bioconductor website provide that information without the need to install the package itself.
Instead, prospective users are presented with documents (PDF or HTML) written by developers to demonstrate how the functions available in the package are meant to be used and combined into a complete workflow.
Often, vignettes use standard data sets preprocessed and freely available from public repositories, including [ExperimentData][glossary-experiment-package] packages or the Bioconductor `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("ExperimentHub")`.

In the "Details" section of the landing page, many packages provide a field labelled "BugReports".
That field provides a URL that users can visit to report bugs to the package developer(s).

> ## Note
> 
> It can be difficult to distinguish actual software bugs from user mistakes made when using the package.
> Later in this episode, we provide advice for reporting bugs and including sufficient information to receive the fastest and most helpful responses.
> 
> In doubt, the [Biocondutor support site][bioc-support-site] can also be a great place to discuss individual experiences and share knowledge about packages and best practices.

Additionally, the landing page provides many other pieces of information, from daily build reports indicating whether the package passed all tests on a range of operating systems, to software dependencies indicating the number of other Bioconductor packages that must be installed before the package itself can be installed and used on the user's system.

> ## Going further
> 
> Each package has a landing page for each release of Bioconductor since the package was added to the repository, e.g.:
> 
> - <https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/3.14/bioc/html/BiocVersion.html>
> - <https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/3.13/bioc/html/BiocVersion.html>
> - <https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/3.12/bioc/html/BiocVersion.html>
> 
> In the URL of a package landing page, we can replace the version number by the word "release" or "devel" to access the landing page of the latest stable release or development version, respectively.
> 
> - <https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/BiocPkgTools.html>
> - <https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/html/BiocPkgTools.html>

# Package vignettes

Each Bioconductor package is required to include at least one vignette.
Many packages have more than one vignette, often separating core functionality from specific use cases.

As we noted earlier in this episode, vignettes are available from [package landing pages][self-package-landing-page] on the Bioconductor website.
However, the landing page only links to the documentation of the most recent version of the package for each version of Bioconductor.
This may be a different version from the one that is installed in the user's R library and used in the R session.

When Bioconductor packages are installed in the user's R library, the vignettes associated with that particular version of the package are also installed on the user's computer.
Those locally installed vignettes are the gold standard reference for the version of the package that is currently installed in the R library and used in the R session.
They can be accessed using the function `browseVignettes()`, for instance:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
browseVignettes("S4Vectors")
```

The function `browseVignettes()` opens a local web page in the user's default web browser, listing all the vignettes available for the requested package.
Each vignette is available in three formats:

- precompiled, in PDF or HTML format
- source, in Sweave or R markdown format
- as an R script

The precompiled format is often the most comfortable format to read, as the PDF and HTML formats allow the contents of the documents to be preview in one integrated view.
This includes plain text explanations, as well as code and their outputs, both figures and console messages.

# The Bioconductor support site

The [Bioconductor support site][bioc-support-site] provides a platform for the community of users and developers to ask questions, and help each other through the doubts and challenges related to Bioconductor packages and analytical workflows.

The support site can be freely browsed without an account to search and read the many questions that were already asked and answered.
However, posting a new question does require an account on the platform.
Signing up to the platform is straightforward using an email address or Open Authorization from a number of trusted providers.

A system of upvoting allows the most popular answers to feature more prominently at the top of each page.
Furthermore, the original poster retains the right to mark one answer as the one that resolved their issue.

Separately, a system of points granted to each user for providing answers either popular or accepted by the original poster highlights the most active and trusted contributors on the platform.
